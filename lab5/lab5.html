<i>Project</i> Labs
</div>
<p>This and the remaining labs in this course will be somewhat different
than the labs we’ve done so far. They will each be worth 40 points, and
you will have more time to do them. These labs will be moderately larger
than previous labs, but the extra time is primarily to give you the
opportunity to devise and plan out your approach. As such, there will
also have less in terms of step-by-step procedures to follow. Developing
your independent problem-solving skills is crucial to using computers to
solve problems, so these labs put an emphasis on practicing these
skills.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In this lab you will write a program that analyzes the letter
frequencies in text documents and then generate new documents based on
those frequencies. Consider the following three quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Call me Ishmael. Some years ago–never mind how long precisely–having
repeatedly smelt the spleen respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a
bad cold in his grego pockets, and throwing grim about with his tomahawk
from the bowsprit?</p>
<p>Call me Ishmael. Some years ago–never mind how long precisely–having
little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on
shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of
the world.</p>
<p>Call me Ishmael, said I to myself. We hast seen that the lesser man
is far more prevalent than winds from the fishery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second quote is the first sentence of Herman Melville’s 1851
novel, Moby Dick. The other two quotes were generated <em>in Melville’s
style</em> using a simple algorithm developed by Claude Shannon in
1948<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. You will implement Shannon’s
algorithm in this lab.</p>
<p>The goals for this lab are</p>
<ul>
<li>Practice using Map data structures to efficiently store associated
data</li>
<li>Implement a program with more interacting pieces than previous
labs</li>
<li>Practice your design skills on a more open-ended assignment</li>

</ul>
<p>You can, of course, opt to use <code>HashMap</code>s directly in the
<code>TextGenerator</code> class instead of implementing
<code>LetterInventory</code> and <code>FrequencyTable</code>, though I
expect having these separate classes will make the code easier to write,
test, and debug.</p>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<h3 id="level-0-analysis">Level 0 analysis</h3>
<p>The following algorithm is based on letter probability distributions.
Imagine taking the novel <em>Tom Sawyer</em> and counting the frequency
with which each character occurs. You’d probably find that spaces are
the most common, that the character <code>'e'</code> is fairly common,
and that the character <code>'q'</code> is rather uncommon. After
completing this <em>level 0</em> analysis, you’d be able to produce
<em>Tom Sawyer</em>-esque text based on character frequencies. The idea
is to randomly select each character based on the probability of its
occurrence in the text. This random text wouldn’t have much in common
with the real novel, but characters would tend to appear with the same
proportions. In fact, here’s an example of what a <em>level 0</em>
analysis might produce:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>rla bsht eS ststofo hhfosdsdewno oe wee h .mr ae irii ela iad o r te
u t mnyto onmalysnce, ifu en c fDwn oee iteo</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="level-1-analysis">Level 1 analysis</h3>
<p>Now imagine doing a slightly more sophisticated level 1 analysis by
determining <em>the frequency with which each character follows every
other character</em>. You would probably discover that <code>'h'</code>
is more likely to follow <code>'t'</code> than <code>'x'</code>, and you
would probably discover that a space follows <code>'.'</code> more
frequently than <code>','</code> does.</p>
<p>More concretely, if you are analyzing the text
<code>"the theater is their thing"</code>, <code>'e'</code> appears
after <code>'h'</code> three times, and <code>'i'</code> appears after
<code>'h'</code> one time; no other letters appear after
<code>'h'</code>. So, given this example,</p>
<ul>
<li>the <em>probability</em> that <code>'e'</code> follows
<code>'h'</code> is <code>0.75</code>,</li>
<li>the <em>probability</em> that <code>'i'</code> follows
<code>'h'</code> is <code>0.25</code>,</li>
<li>the <em>probability</em> that any other letter follows
<code>'h'</code> is <code>0</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using a <em>level 1</em> analysis, you could produce randomly
generated <em>Tom Sawyer</em>-esque text by 1) picking a character, and
then 2) always choosing the next character based on the probability of
the next character given the chosen character. Here’s an example of
<em>level 1</em> random text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Shand tucthiney m?” le ollds mind Theybooure He, he s whit Pereg
lenigabo Jodind alllld ashanthe ainofevids tre lin–p asto oun
theanthadomoere</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="level-k-analysis">Level <em>k</em> analysis</h3>
<p>Now imagine doing a <em>level k</em> analysis by determining the
probability with which each character <em>follows every possible
sequence of characters of length k</em>. For example, a <em>level 5</em>
analysis of <em>Tom Sawyer</em> would reveal that <code>'r'</code>
follows <code>"Sawye"</code> more frequently than any other character.
After a <em>level k</em> analysis, you would be able to generate <em>Tom
Sawyer</em>-esque text by always choosing the next character based on
the previous <em>k</em> characters and the probabilities revealed by the
analysis.</p>
<p>At only a moderate level of analysis (levels 5–7), randomly-generated
text begins to take on many of the characteristics of the source text.
It probably won’t make complete sense, but you’ll be able to tell that
it was derived from Tom Sawyer as opposed to, say, Moby Dick. Here are
some more examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Level 2:) “Yess been.” for gothin, Tome oso; ing, in to weliss of
an’te cle - armit. Papper a comeasione, and smomenty, fropeck hinticer,
sid, a was Tom, be suck tied. He sis tred a youck to themen</p>
<p>(Level 4) en themself, Mr. Welshman, but him awoke, the balmy shore.
I’ll give him that he couple overy because in the slated snufflindeed
structure’s kind was rath. She said that the wound the door a fever eyes
that WITH him.</p>
<p>(Level 6:) people had eaten, leaving. Come - didn’t stand it better
judgment; His hands and bury it again, tramped herself! She’d never
would be. He found her spite of anything the one was a prime feature
sunset, and hit upon that of the forever.</p>
<p>(Level 8:) look-a-here - I told you before, Joe. I’ve heard a pin
drop. The stillness was complete, however, this is awful crime, beyond
the village was sufficient. He would be a good enough to get that night,
Tom and Becky.</p>
<p>(Level 10:) you understanding that they don’t come around in the cave
should get the word “beauteous” was over-fondled, and that together” and
decided that he might as we used to do - it’s nobby fun. I’ll learn
you.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once we have processed input text and stored it in a map structure
that allows us to check frequencies, we pick <em>k</em> letters (for
example, the first <em>k</em> in the input text) to use as a
<em>seed</em> for our new text. Then we choose subsequent characters
based on the preceding <em>k</em> characters and their frequency
information. We would need to pick a starting <em>k</em> letters that
actually appear in the input text, so we have information about what
letter should come next.</p>
<h2 id="program-design-and-implementation">Program Design and
Implementation</h2>
<p>This lab is deliberately more open-ended than the previous few labs.
It’s important to practice the skill of designing your own approach to a
new problem. So instead of a step-by-step procedure, this section
contains general guidance I think might be useful to you.</p>
<p>The class that will run your program, <code>TextGenerator</code>, is
the only one provided in the starter project. It must have the given
constructor (<code>public TextGenerator(int k, String filename)</code>)
and method (<code>public String generate(int length)</code>), as the
grading test cases depend on those. Beyond that, you are free to use any
design you choose. One possible approach is discussed below.</p>
<p>When thinking about the design, focus on what would constitute a good
data structure for this problem. Your data structure needs to keep a
table of info and be able to support two key operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>update the frequencies in the table, given a string of <em>k</em>
characters and the succeeding character.</li>
<li>select a next character, given a string of <em>k</em> characters and
the frequencies stored in your table.</li>
</ul>
<p>You might try to save the frequency information in a big array, but
the size will quickly become too large. For <span
class="math inline"><em>k</em> = 2</span>, you would need a
three-dimensional array whose size is about 27,000 entries if you
include blanks and punctuation. For larger <em>k</em>, the number of
entries grows rapidly.</p>
<p>Instead, you could develop a <code>FrequencyTable</code> class
implemented with a <code>HashMap</code>. The <code>HashMap</code> could
store character sequences (i.e., <code>String</code>s) as the
<em>keys</em> and <code>LetterInventory</code>s as the <em>values</em>
(i.e.,
<code>private HashMap&lt;String, LetterInventory&gt; table</code>). The
<code>LetterInventory</code> is a class (which you would also develop)
that keeps track of which characters appear after a given sequence,
along with a frequency.</p>
<p>There are many ways to implement a <code>LetterInventory</code>. A
good start is… another <code>HashMap</code>! Thus, the letter
inventory’s <code>HashMap</code> stores key-value pairs where each
<em>key</em> is a single character (stored as a <code>Character</code>)
and each <em>value</em> is the number of times the given letter occurs
after the <em>k</em>-character sequence with which the inventory is
associated (stored as an <code>Integer</code>). This would have type
<code>HashMap&lt;Character, Integer&gt;</code>. Think carefully about
what methods the letter inventory should have.</p>
<!-- As a guide, here's how my own solution broke down:

- `TextGenerator`: I wrote 2 methods, about 10 lines each
- `FrequencyTable`: I wrote 4 methods, about 2 lines each
- `LetterInventory`: I wrote 2 very short methods, and one longer method to implement the algorithm described in the [Selecting the next character] section -->
<h3 id="selecting-a-random-key">Selecting a random key</h3>
<p>Let’s say you have a field
<code>HashMap&lt;String, LetterInventory&gt; table</code> and you want
to select a random key from the map. You might want to do something like
this in order to pick an initial <em>k</em>-length string for
<code>generate</code> to start with (or better yet, implement a
<code>FrequencyTable</code> method that provides this functionality).
Doing this turns out to be a little cumbersome in Java. The first step
is to get an array of all the keys:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode java"><code class="sourceCode java"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="bu">Object</span><span class="op">[]</span> keys <span class="op">=</span> table<span class="op">.</span><span class="fu">keySet</span><span class="op">().</span><span class="fu">toArray</span><span class="op">();</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>keys</code> is type <code>Object[]</code> because the
<code>toArray</code> method returns an array of <code>Object</code>s.
Next we can use the <code>StdRandom</code> class from the algs4 library
to generate a random index for this array:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre
class="sourceCode java"><code class="sourceCode java"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="bu">String</span> randomKey <span class="op">=</span> <span class="op">(</span><span class="bu">String</span><span class="op">)</span> keys<span class="op">[</span>StdRandom<span class="op">.</span><span class="fu">uniform</span><span class="op">(</span>keys<span class="op">.</span><span class="fu">length</span><span class="op">)];</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="selecting-the-next-character">Selecting the next character</h3>
<p>As part of this frequency analysis approach, you will be faced with
the situation of having characters and associated counts (in say, your
<code>LetterInventory</code> class), and needing to select a character
with probability proportional to its frequency (see <a
href="#level-1-analysis">Level 1 analysis</a> for an example). Here’s an
algorithm you might use to accomplish this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Find the sum of all the counts, call it <code>total</code></li>
<li>Generate a random number between 0 and 1, call it
<code>threshold</code> (e.g.,
<code>threshhold = StdRandom.uniform();</code>)</li>
<li>Loop over the each <code>letter</code> and the associated
<code>count</code>
<ol type="1">
<li>Update <code>threshold</code> to
<code>threshold - count / total</code></li>
<li>If <code>threshold</code> is less than zero, select
<code>letter</code></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>The basic idea is that we convert each count into a probability by
dividing it by the sum of all counts. By subtracting each probability
from our random <code>threshold</code>, we give each letter the
appropriate chance of being selected.</p>
<p>For example, assume these probabilities are 0.3, 0.5, and 0.2. A
random number between 0 and 1 has a 30% chance of being less than 0.3,
so <code>threshold - 0.3</code> has a 30% of being less than 0. It also
has a 50% chance of being between 0.3 and 0.8, so
<code>threshold - 0.3 - 0.5</code> has a 50% chance of being less than
0. Finally, the random number has a 20% chance of being between 0.8 and
1, so there’s a 20% chance the previous two letters weren’t selected and
we select the third.</p>
<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>The starter project includes JUnit test cases to assess the
correctness of the <code>generate</code> method of the
<code>TextGenerator</code> class. See <a href="#grading">Grading</a> for
how each test case contributes to your lab grade.</p>
<p>You should build your program in stages that you have <em>planned out
ahead of time</em>. While writing and debugging your code, try using the
<code>small.txt</code> input file (containing only
<code>the theater is their thing</code>) and a <em>k</em> of 1. Using
these fixed parameters will help you ensure the correctness of your code
since you can verify the correct answers by hand on paper.</p>
<p>One benefit of breaking up your program into several classes
(<code>LetterInventory</code>, <code>FrequencyTable</code>, and
<code>TextGenerator</code>) as described in <a
href="#program-design-and-implementation">Program Design and
Implementation</a> is that you can test each piece independently. As you
work on each class, write a <code>main</code> method that constructs an
instance of your class and calls all its <code>public</code> methods,
printing their return values. That was you can assess whether these
methods are working as expected. I have added a warning to
<code>checkstyle</code> about creating such a <code>main</code> method
to help you remember.</p>
<h2 id="style">Style</h2>
<p>You are expected to submit files that contains no
<code>checkstyle</code> errors <em>or warnings</em>. You will lose 0.5
points per error (up to a maximum of 3) and per warning (up to a maximum
of 2), as indicated in the <a href="#grading">Grading</a> breakdown.</p>
<div class="box alert_box">
<div class="warning">
<code>checkstyle</code> Warnings
</div>
<p>For this and all following labs you are expected to address
<strong>ALL</strong> <code>checkstyle</code> problems, including
warnings.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<p>Consider attempting any or all of these additional challenges if you
have time:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Timing</strong> (1 point). Using the <a
href="https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/javadoc/edu/princeton/cs/algs4/StopwatchCPU.html"><code>StopwatchCPU</code></a>
class from algs4, measure the running time of generating 1000 characters
of text for different input files and values of <em>k</em> (time the
whole process, including reading the input file and building up the
table of frequencies). Based on these results, what is the big-O running
time in terms of <em>n</em> (number of characters in the input file) and
<em>k</em>? Submit a text file or a spreadsheet with your results and
interpretation.</li>
<li><strong>Word-based analysis</strong> (1 point). Instead of working
at the character level, you could work at the word level. Instead of
sequences of <em>k</em> characters, your analysis would consider
sequences of <em>k</em> words (and the frequency of subsequent words).
How would this affect your program design? Does word-level analysis make
the results better or worse in any way? Is your word-level analysis more
or less sensitive to your choice of k? Why? Implement this word-based
text generation as a separate Java class and submit the file.</li>
<li><strong>The Soundex Name Lookup System</strong> (2 points). Complete
Lab 15.8 from Bailey (The Soundex Name Lookup System).</li>

Challenges
</div>
<p>Challenges are a way to go above and beyond what is expected for a
lab. Only attempt them <em>after you are completely finished with all
other parts of the lab</em>. Completing all the non-challenge components
of a lab will earn 38/40 (95%, an A). Earning challenge points can
result in a grade higher than 100%.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>This lab will be graded out of 40 points as shown below. While most
of the points for this lab are associated with specific test cases,
partial credit can be earned for test cases that don’t pass. It it
possible to earn a passing graded even if your submission does not pass
any tests. Partial credit will be awarded based on evidence of a
good-faith effort to implement the related features. Comments explaining
your approach can help earn partial credit.</p>
